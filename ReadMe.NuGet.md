# Breaking news  
The ListViewZero and TreeViewZero now use native scrollbars and therefore we gain all the platform goodness like 
mouse-support, velocity and acceleration management etc.  
Big shout out to [Jeff Siemens](https://github.com/jsiemensLatitudegeo) for the PR making all that happen, as well as fixing linting errors and a VSM ItemFocused issue!
